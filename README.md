### Fiona Nyaanga / Student ID: 0005013201 
 Hello my name is Fiona Nyaanga. I am a student from Full Sail University. The purpose of this repository is to practice development using version control. This work will help me begin to build a portfolio of skills and accomplishment that can be shared in the future. 
 
I currently reside in Dallas, Texas. I was born in Nairobi, Kenya and immigrated to Minneapolis, Minnesota in 2009 where I stayed for 9 years before moving to Dallas. I have unlimited hobbies, from sports especially soccer, to designing spaces, all the way to wanting to cook something 24/7. This is my first year studying anything in IT, but I believe it was the best choice I've made in a very long time. I'm currently searching for an internship to count towards experience, but I'm hoping that I will get a very good career out of this degree. Not only for me but for my daughter as well.

## Progress Check / Stand Up
Each week, I will summarize my milestone activity and progress by including a **Stand-Up**. A "stand-up" is when I take the time to briefly report out on the following...

1. **Accomplishments** - What I worked on this past week
2. **Challenges** - Any challenges I may have (and how I am addressing those challenges)
3. **Next Steps** - What I plan to prioritize and do next 
   

<br>

**Week 1**: The first week of this class I we learned and studied about Project Management and Reversion control. And out of all of it I knew very little information to start of with. But something that I'll be taking with me is the definition of Reversion Control, it's responsible for recording changes to files overtime. I did encounter a few challenges such as, working GitHub and finished out how I'll be using Terminal. I plan to prioritize my knowledge on GitHub and become way more comfortable with it. 

**Week 2**: This week we are going over Refactoring and working on our prototypes. I never heard of the word refracturing until this weeks class, it's basically a technique for restructuring an existing body of code. I had a lot of enjoyment while building up my prototype and trying to figure out some designs. At first I tried to match the exact color scheme of my resume but decided that it wasn't the best idea to begin with. I did have some challenges working with Figma, and i still am but it's getting more and more familiar. I plan to completely plan out my prototype so I can be ahead of my busy home/work/school schedule. 

**Week 3**: I'm having a lot of fun this week working on my prototype, and switching things out. I accidentally deleted my original prototype but managed to create and even better one, and decide on a theme. 

**Week 4**:
